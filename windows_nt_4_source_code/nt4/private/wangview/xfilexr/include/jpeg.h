 *    Rev 1.0   12 Jun 1996 05:47:16   BLDR
 *  
 * 
 *    Rev 1.0   01 Jan 1996 11:24:04   MHUGHES
 * Initial revision.
 * Revision 1.16  1994/11/08  00:20:35  lperry
 * lperry on Mon Nov 7 16:16:21 PST 1994
 *
 * jpeg.h -> /product/ipcore/ipshared/include/RCS/jpeg.h,v
 *
 * Change code issuing error messages to eliminate
 * the strings in the ERREXIT macros. Unless the
 * value JDEBUG is defined, these strings are replaced
 * with NULL. (Clients still get the error code returned
 * which can be translated to a string by jerrorString().
 * Also defined away all the warning and trace code, which
 * was a no-op now anyway, to nothing.
 * All this trims about 6Kbytes off the JPEG libraries.
 *
 * Revision 1.15  1994/10/21  00:52:07  lperry
 * lperry on Thu Oct 20 17:51:55 PDT 1994
 *
 * jpeg.h -> /product/ipcore/ipshared/include/RCS/jpeg.h,v
 *
 * Get rid of UINT32, etc., so these files can work with Peter's interpreter.
 *
 * Revision 1.14  1994/09/08  00:17:35  lperry
 * jpeg.h -> /product/ipcore/ipshared/include/RCS/jpeg.h,v
 *
 * Conditionally define away IP_RCSINFO macro on PRODUCTION.
 *
 * Revision 1.13  1994/09/07  18:44:35  lperry
 * jpeg.h -> /product/ipcore/ipshared/include/RCS/jpeg.h,v
 *
 * Abbreviate the RCSINFO macro to remove the date, reducing string size.
 *
 * Revision 1.12  1994/08/01  20:41:43  lperry
 * lperry on Mon Aug 1 13:38:24 PDT 1994
 *
 * jpeg.h -> /product/ipcore/ipshared/include/RCS/jpeg.h,v
 *
 * Add complete declarations of parameters to function pointers
 * for the read and write callback functions in the cinfo
 * structure.
 *
 * Revision 1.11  1994/07/26  00:35:01  lperry
 * lperry on Mon Jul 25 17:30:44 PDT 1994
 *
 * jpeg.h -> /product/ipcore/ipshared/include/RCS/jpeg.h,v
 *
 * Added a test for the predefined variable "applec"
 * so that MPW compiles of the JPEG code pick up all
 * the right STDC definitions. Previous version
 * was defining a UInt16 to be an unsigned int
 * instead of an usigned short.
 *
 * Revision 1.10  1994/07/21  00:18:53  lperry
 * lperry on Wed Jul 20 17:18:50 PDT 1994
 *
 * jpeg.h -> /product/ipcore/ipshared/include/RCS/jpeg.h,v
 *
 * Change error handling from old setjmp/longjmp to function return codes.
 *
 * Revision 1.9  1994/06/27  17:13:19  lperry
 * lperry on Mon Jun 27 10:08:37 PDT 1994
 *
 * jpeg.h -> /product/ipcore/ipshared/include/RCS/jpeg.h,v
 *
 * Added formerly static parameters from the jpeg functions
 * to the "cinfo" structure, which is passed to almost all
 * routines. This was done to achieve reentrant code which
 * can be used in DLL's.
 *
 * Also merged the structure definitions for the compression
 * and decompression process into a single structure. (About
 * 70% of the structure members were identical in the two versions
 * anyway). This allows the same structure to be passed to a
 * compression or decompression function, eliminating the need
 * for several essentially duplicate functions in the two modes.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  1994/05/24  00:43:11  lperry
 * lperry on Mon May 23 17:41:16 PDT 1994
 *
 * jpeg.h -> /product/ipcore/ipshared/include/RCS/jpeg.h,v
 *
 * Added constants for specifying users data organization (JMEMORG_XXX)
 * Added hooks to cinfo/dinfo structures for specifying byte swapping
 * routines and internal buffers. These had been globals before.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  1994/05/05  01:39:03  ddavies
 * jpeg.h -> /product/ipcore/ipshared/include/RCS/jpeg.h,v
 *
 * Define MIN and MAX only if they're not already defined.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  1994/05/03  20:38:09  ddavies
 * ddavies on Tue May 3 13:37:49 PDT 1994
 *
 * jpeg.h -> /product/ipcore/ipshared/include/RCS/jpeg.h,v
 *
 * Add ansiprot.h so gcc sees a prototype for memset.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  1994/04/08  00:29:03  lperry
 * lperry on Thu Apr 7 17:25:13 PDT 1994
 *
 * jpeg.h -> /product/ipcore/ipshared/include/RCS/jpeg.h,v
 *
 * Added macro JALLOC for memory allocation with proper casting.
 *
 * Commented out a conditional define of "const" to null
 * which tested the value of STDC. This didn't cause the
 * compiler any problems, but cextract couldn't handle it.
 * (We've been assuming all our compilers are ANSI anyway).
 *
 * Revision 1.4  1994/03/26  00:46:44  ddavies
 * ddavies on Fri Mar 25 16:45:22 PST 1994
 *
 * jpeg.h -> /product/ipcore/ipshared/include/RCS/jpeg.h,v
 *
 * Add "const" to declaration of jerrorString to make gcc happy.  This routine
 * returns pointers to strings used to tell folks about errors.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  1994/03/24  23:43:59  lperry
 * lperry on Thu Mar 24 15:40:00 PST 1994
 *
 * jpeg.h -> /product/ipcore/ipshared/include/RCS/jpeg.h,v
 *
 * Add a parameter to the decompression data structure to
 * indicate that the DCT blocks should be filled with the
 * DC (average) value (dinfo.dcOnly). This variable being
 * set to True will cause the decompressor to skip the
 * reverse DCT step, saving a significant chunk of time
 * (actually only about 15%).
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1994/03/12  01:16:24  dferrell
 * dferrell on Fri Mar 11 17:13:48 PST 1994
 *
 * jpeg.h -> /product/ipcore/ipshared/include/RCS/jpeg.h,v
 *
 * Fixed problem related to __STDC__ not being defined by MPW C.  This
 * change only affects compilation on the Mac.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  1994/02/28  17:26:31  lperry
 * Initial revision
 *
 * Revision 1.1  1994/02/27  02:39:59  lperry
