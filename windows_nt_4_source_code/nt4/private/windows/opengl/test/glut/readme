This directory contains the initial version of GLUT for both the
X Window System and Win32.  GLUT API version 2 is supported.

In order to use GLUT you need to move glut.h from this directory to
wherever you intend to pick up your header files from.  This is usually
wherever the other OpenGL header files are.

Currently GLUT for Win32 only compiles for x86.
