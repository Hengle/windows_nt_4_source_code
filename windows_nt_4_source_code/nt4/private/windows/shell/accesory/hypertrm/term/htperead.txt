What is HyperTerminal Private Edition?
--------------------------------------

   HyperTerminal Private Edition is a more powerful version of
Hilgraeve's HyperTerminal communications program, which Microsoft
includes in every copy of Windows 95.  HyperTerminal PE is
distributed free by Hilgraeve in the hope that you will enjoy it
and someday buy our full-featured program, HyperACCESS.

   You can download HyperTerminal Private Edition, Version 1.1
now from Hilgraeve's web page (http://www.hilgraeve.com) or the
HyperTerminal BBS (313-243-9957).  You can also pick up icons
(HyperTerminal session files) for other BBSs and online systems
that you can call.  Call again any time, to download subsequent
versions of HyperTerminal PE, or to post comments or bug reports.
We read all messages but seldom answer back, so please expect no
response. User input is important to us and we appreciate your
taking the time to send it.


---------------------------------
How HyperTerminal PE is Different
---------------------------------

   On the surface, HyperTerminal PE seems almost identical to
HyperTerminal (except for its animated banner screen).  Both are
speedy 32-bit programs that take full advantage of the Windows 95
interface and key features, such as TAPI (Telephony API) and
Unimodem universal modem support.  And both support Hilgraeve's
CommSense feature (pat. pending), which automatically identifies
and sets parameters such as parity, stop bits and data bits, so
you can call new online systems simply by entering their phone
numbers.

   Yet HyperTerminal PE offers several substantial advantages
over the HyperTerminal program Microsoft currently includes with
Windows 95.  It adds the three features most often requested by
HyperTerminal users: Automatic re-dial of busy phone numbers;
Zmodem crash recovery for resuming interrupted file transfers;
and support for foreign characters.

   HyperTerminal PE also corrects some problems identified after
the Windows 95 code freeze.  It transfers files properly through
direct cable connections, and enumerates country codes correctly
even if more than one TAPI service provider is installed.  Its
character delay setting now throttles text sending even when
pasting from the clipboard.  It also fixes problems that occurred
with certain printers, and subtle errors in Minitel terminal
emulation.

   HyperTerminal PE version 1.1 makes it easier for the user to 
type commands directly to the modem. This is useful to experienced users
who wish to test the modem, or even place the modem in answer mode. 
It does this by allowing the user to type characters to the terminal 
area without first defining a name and icon for the new connection. 
This will open the first device listed by Windows 95 and will transmit 
the characters to that device.If you would like to choose a different 
device -- another modem or port -- simply open the properties for that 
connection and change to another device. HyperTerminal no longer 
requires you to enter a phone number before this dialog is dismissed.

-------------------------------------
Installing and Using HyperTerminal PE
-------------------------------------

   HyperTerminal Private Edition, Version 1.1 is provided as a
file called HTPE1.ZIP, which contains (in compressed format) all
of the files you need for HyperTerminal PE.  Follow these
instructions to install HyperTerminal PE as a replacement for
HyperTerminal:

1. Use PKUNZIP to unpack HTPE1.ZIP into a temporary directory. 

2. Open an MS-DOS window and change to the directory containing
your existing HyperTerminal program, by entering:

       CD C:\Program~1\Access~1\Hypert~1 

3. Enter ATTRIB -H *.DLL to make the .DLL files in this directory
visible.

4. (Leaving the MS-DOS window open) momentarily disable Windows
95's registry. To do this, select Shut Down... to display the
Shut Down dialog.  In this dialog, hold down Shift+Ctrl+Alt while
you click the No button.  This will make the Task Bar and other
visible features of Explorer go away.  Don't be alarmed; step 6
will restore them.

5. Copy the HyperTerminal PE files from the temporary directory
into the HyperTerminal directory.  (You may wish to make backup
copies of your former files first.)

6. To restore the Windows 95 desktop to normal, enter EXPLORER in
the MS-DOS window.

   That's it!  HyperTerminal PE is now ready to use.  You start
and use it the same as the HyperTerminal program provided with
Windows 95; see Windows 95 for documentation or Help for
instructions.

-------------------------
Use of Special Characters
-------------------------

   If you find that special character aren't being sent or 
displayed correctly by HyperTerminal, try changing to a different 
font. Due to the way Windows 95 maps characters under different 
fonts, you will see a different character displayed if you are 
using the Terminal font as opposed to the other available fonts.
