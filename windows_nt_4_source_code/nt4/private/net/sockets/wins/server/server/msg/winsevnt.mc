MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_NO_RECS_IN_NAM_ADD_TBL
Language=English
The Database of Name to Address Mappings is empty.  It could mean that a
previous invocation of WINS created the database and then went down before
any registration could be done.
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_NO_RECS_IN_OWN_ADD_TBL
Language=English
The Database of Owner to Address Mappings is empty.  It could mean that a
previous invocation of WINS created the table and then went down before
t could add its own entry to it.  The WINS server went down real fast 
(i.e. even before all its threads could become fully operational.  
.


MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_CANT_GET_INITRPL_VAL
Language=English
WINS could not read the InitTimeReplication field of the PULL/PUSH key. 
.

Language=English
WINS could not read the Tombstone Timeout from the Registry 
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_CANT_GET_CC_INTERVAL_VAL
Language=English
WINS could not read the "ConsistencyCheck" value (type DWORD) from under the
Parameters\ConsistencyCheck key its  registry.  This value is used by WINS 
to do periodic consistency checks. The first consistency check is done at the 
time specified in the SpTime value under the ConsistencyCheck key and limited 
by the "MaxRecsAtATime" value. If the time is not specified, the check is done 
at 2 am.   
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_CANT_GET_CC_MAX_RECS_AAT_VAL
Language=English
WINS could not read the MaxRecsAtATime value (type DWORD) of the 
Wins\Parameters\ConsistencyCheck key. Set this value if you do not want WINS 
to replicate more than a set number of records in one cycle while doing 
periodic consistency checks on  its database.  When doing consistency check, 
WINS replicates all records of an owner WINS by either going to that WINS or 
to a replication partner.  At the end of doing consistency check for an owner's 
records, it checks to see if it has replicated more than the above specified 
value in the current  consistency  check cycle. If yes, it stops, else it continues. In the next cycle, it starts from where it left off, wrapping around to
the first owner if required. 
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_CANT_GET_CC_USE_RPL_PNRS_VAL
Language=English
WINS could not read the "UseRplPnrs" value of the 
Wins\Parameters\ConsistencyCheck key. Ifthis value is set to a non-zero (DWORD)
value, WINS will do consistency check of the owners in its database by going 
to one or more of its replication partners.  If the owner of the records 
happens to be a replication partner, WINS will go to it, else it will pick 
one at random.  Set this value if you have a large number of WINSs in your 
configuration and/or if you do not want the local WINS to go to any WINS that 
is not a replication partner. 
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_CC_STATS
Language=English
WINS just did consistency check on the records owned by WINS with address %1.
The number of records inserted, updated, deleted are in the data section below
(2nd, 3rd, 4th DWORDS).
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_CC_FAILED
Language=English
WINS could not do consistency checking on records.  This could be because WINS
was directed to do the consistency checking only with replication partners and
it currently does not have any pull replication partners.  To get around this
problem, you should either allow WINS to do consistency check with owner WINSs 
or configure the WINS with one or more pull partners. 
.


MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_PKT_FORMAT_ERR
Language=English
WINS got a packet that has the wrong format (for example, a label may be more
than 63 octets). 
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_NO_RECS_RETRIEVED
Language=English
No records meeting the %1 criteria were found in the database.
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_NO_RPL_RECS_RETRIEVED
Language=English
WINS's Replicator  could not find any records in the database.  
It means that there are no active or tombstone records in the database.  
It could be that the records being requested by a remote WINS server are 
either released or non-existent. 
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_GRP_LIMIT_REACHED
Language=English
The special group has reached its limit. WINS can not add any more members. 
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_OWNER_LIMIT_REACHED
Language=English
The address database already has reached the limit of owners. This is 100.
This error was noticed while attempting to add the address given below.
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_UPD_NTF_NOT_ACCEPTED
Language=English
The WINS server got an update notification from the WINS server with address 
(%1).  The WINS server rejected it. This means that the remote WINS server
is not in the list of Push partners (WINS  servers under the  PULL key) and 
the administrator has prohibited  (via the  Registry) replication with 
non-configured WINS servers.  If you wish this WINS server to accept update 
notifications from  non-configured WINS servers then  set  
Wins\Paramaters\RplOnlyWCnfPnrs value in the  Registry to 0.
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_UPD_NTF_ACCEPTED
Language=English
The WINS got an update notification from WINS with address (%1).  The WINS 
accepted it.  
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_ADD_VERS_MAP_REQ_NOT_ACCEPTED
Language=English
The WINS server got a pull request from the WINS  server with address (%1).  
The WINS server rejected it since the remote WINS server is not in the list 
of Pull partners (WINS servers under the PUSH key) and the administrator has 
prohibited (via the Registry) replication with non-configured partners.
If you wish this WINS server to accept update notifications from WINS servers 
not in the "pull partner" list, then set the "replication only with  
configured partners" value in the Registry to 0.
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_CANT_OPEN_DATAFILES_KEY
Language=English
The datafiles key could not be opened

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_WINS_ENTRY_DELETED
Language=English
The owner-address mapping table had an entry with owner id non-zero and address
the same as the local WINS address.  The entry has been marked as deleted in the
in-memory table.  
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_INF_REM_WINS_EXC
Language=English
An exception was encountered while trying to inform a remote WINS to update 
the version number.  
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_INF_REM_WINS
Language=English
The local WINS is going to inform a remote WINS to update the version number of
a record.  This is because the local WINS got a clash between an active 
owned name and an active replica that it pulled from a replication partner.
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_REM_WINS_INF
Language=English
The local WINS has been informed by a remote WINS with address %1 to update 
the version number  of a record.  This is because the remote WINS got a clash 
between an active owned name and an active replica that it pulled from a replication partner.
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_CANT_FIND_REC
Language=English
WINS could not find the record it was asked to update the version stamp of 
(by a remote WINS).  Check if the record got deleted or updated.
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_NAME_MISMATCH
Language=English
While verifying the validity of old replicas, a name mismatch was noticed.  
The local record has the name %1 while the replica pulled in from the WINS 
that owns this record has the name %2.  This could mean that the remote 
WINS was brought down and then up again but its version counter value was 
not set to its previous value before termination.
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_VERS_COUNTER_CHANGED
Language=English
The value of the version counter was changed. The new value (Low 32 bits) is given below
.


MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_CNF_CHANGE
Language=English
WINS replication request is being ignored since WINS suspects that the 
Wins\Partners key information has changed (because it got a notification from
the Registry) which makes the current request pertaining to partner old. 
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_DUP_ENTRY_DEL
Language=English
WINS is deleting all records of WINS with owner id = %d.  This owner id. 
corresponds to the address %s.
.

Language=English
WINS has pulled records from a WINS while doing %1.  The partner's address 
and the address of the owner whose records were pulled are given below in the
data section (2 and 3rd DWORD respectively).  The number of records pulled is 
in the 4th DWORD below.
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_CC_NO_RECS
Language=English
WINS did consistency check on records.  The number of records pulled, the 
address of the WINS whose records were pulled, and the address of the WINS
from which these records were pulled are given in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th DWORDs
in the data section below.
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_SCV_RECS
Language=English

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Warning SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_VERS_MISMATCH
Language=English
The local WINS server received a request from a remote WINS server 
that is not of the same version.  Because the WINS servers are not compatible,
the connection was terminated.  The version number of the remote WINS server
is given below. 
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Warning SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_WINSOCK_SEND_MSG_ERR
Language=English
Winsock Send could not send all the bytes.  Connection could have been 
aborted by  the remote client.
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Warning SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_ADJ_TIME_INTVL_R
Language=English
Wins adjusted a scavenging related time interval (%1) so that it is 
compatible with the replication time intervals. The adjusted value 
for this scavenging parameter is given in the data section 
(2nd DWORD).  Ths value was computed by WINS using an algorithm that 
may use the max. replication time interval specified.  The current value 
achieves a good balance between consistency of databases across the 
network of WINS servers and the performance of the WINS servers. For 
more information on defaults/min/max values for scavenging related 
parameters, refer to the  TCP/IP documentation or help file.

.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Warning SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_WINSOCK_SELECT_TIMED_OUT
Language=English
The timeout period has expired on a call to another WINS server. Assuming that 
the network and routers are working properly, either the remote WINS server is 
overloaded, or its TCP listener thread has terminated.
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Warning SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_UNABLE_TO_VERIFY
Language=English
The Scavenger thread found active replicas that needed to be verified with the
owner WINS server since they were older than the verify time interval.  The 
table of owner to address mappings indicated the WINS server to be not ACTIVE.
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Warning SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_LIMIT_MULTIH_ADD_REACHED
Language=English
The name registration packet that was just received has too many addresses. The maximum number of addresses for a multi-homed client is 25. The number of addresses found in the packet is given below. 
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Warning SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_REPLICA_CLASH_W_STATIC
Language=English
A replica clashed with the static record %1 in the database.  The replica was rejected.
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Warning SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_RPC_NOT_INIT
Language=English
WINS could not initialize the administrator interface because of some problem with the RPC service. You may not be able to administer WINS. 
Make sure that the RPC service is running. 
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Warning SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_NO_NTF_PERS_COMM_FAIL
Language=English
WINS did not send a notification message to the WINS server whose address is 
given below, because it had a number of communications failures with that 
server in the past few minutes. 
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Warning SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_REL_DIFF_OWN
Language=English
WINS got a release for a non-owned name = (%1). This name is owned by WINS whose
owner id is given below. You can run winscl.exe to get the owner id. to address
mapping.
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Warning SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_REC_DELETED
Language=English
The Administrator has deleted a record with name (%1). 
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Warning SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_DB_RESTORED
Language=English
WINS was unable to come up because of some database error.  WINS therefore
restored the old database from the backup directory and will try to come
up with it.
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Warning SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_PARTIAL_RPL_TYPE
Language=English
CAUTION: A non-zero replication type applies for this partner.  
This means that only a subset of records will be replicated between the 
local WINS and this partner.  If later you want to get records that did not 
replicate, you can either pull them through winscl.exe in the RES KIT or
delete all owners acquired only through this partner and initiate replication
after that to reacquire all their records. The partner's address is given in
the second DWORD of the data section.
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Warning SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_PNR_PARTIAL_RPL_TYPE
Language=English
CAUTION: A partner has requested only a subset of records. This means that
we won't replicate all the records in the range requested.  Check the partner's
registry to see what replication type applies to it. The partner's address is
given in the second DWORD of the data section below. 
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Warning SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_ADJ_MAX_RECS_AAT
Language=English
Wins adjusted the Max. Recs at a time parameters of the ConsistencyCheck key.
The value specified (%2) was changed to the minimum = (%1).  These are the
the maximum number of records that will be replicated to do consistency checks
at any one time. 
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Informational SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_FORCE_SCV_R_T
Language=English
WINS was forced to scavenge replica tombstones of a WINS.  WINS does not
scavenge replica tombstones unless they have timed out and the WINS has been
running for atleast 3 days (This is to ensure that the tombstones have
replicated to other WINSs).  In this case, the tombstones were timed out but
the WINS had not been up for 3 days.  The admin. forced the scavenging through
winscl.exe. The replica tombstones were deleted. This deletion does not
constitute a problem unless you have WINS servers that are primary and backup
to clients but not both Push and Pull partners of each other.  If you do have
such WINSs, there is a low probability that this action will result in database
inconsistency but if it does (as you will discover eventually), you can get
back to a consistent state by initiating consistency checks through winscl.exe.
DO NOTE, THE CONSISTENCY CHECK IS A NETWORK AND RESOURCE INTENSIVE OPERATION.
YOU SHOULD INITIATE IT ONLY WITH A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT DOES.
You are better off creating the ConsistencyCheck Key under Wins\Parameters.
READ THE DOCUMENTATION ABOUT IT.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Error SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_WINSOCK_BIND_ERR
Language=English
Could not bind an address to a socket.  This might mean that the 'nameserver'
port (specified in the services file) which is used as default by WINS for 
replication  and discovering other WINSs has been taken by another 
process/service running on this computer. You have two options - either 
bring down that other process/service or direct WINS to use another port.  
If you choose the second option, set the value 'PortNo' (REG_DWORD) under 
Wins\Parameters key in the registry to 1512.  NOTE however that changing the
port no. this way will prevent this WINS from replicating/discovering
other WINSs unless they too are directed to use the same port no. as this
WINS.

The Push Thread was requested for a range of records but could not find any in the range.  This is a serious error.  Make sure that the time intervals are
set properly.  If the tombstone interval and timeout intervals are not correct 
(i.e. too small-- being << the replication interval), the above condition is 
possible. This is because the records might get changed into tombstones and 
then  deleted before the remote WINS can pull them.  In the same vein, if
the refresh interval is set to be << replication interval then the records
could get released before a WINS can pull them (a released record is not 
sent).

WINS has noticed some database corruption.  It will try to recover. 
This recovery process can potentially take a long time.  You should not kill 
WINS in the middle.  If you do you will need to start with a clean database.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Error SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_TERM_DUE_TIME_LMT
Language=English
WINS has waited long enough for all threads to terminate. The number of
threads that are still active is given in the second DWORD below 
(data section).  The thread that could be stuck is the replicator thread. It
could be because of the other WINS being slow in sending data or reading
data.  The latter can contribute to back-pressure on the tcp connection on 
which it is trying to replicate. Check partner WINSs to see if one or more 
is in a bad state.  This WINS is now terminating itself abruptly.

WINS database. Check to see if you have a space before the name. If yes and
you want this space in the name, enclose the name within quotes.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Error SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_DB_RESTORE_GUIDE
Language=English
WINS could not come up due to missing/corrupt database.
Restore the database using WINS Manager or winscl.exe (in the res kit) and then 
restart  WINS. If WINS still does not come up, start with a 
fresh  copy of the database. To do this:

 1) delete all the  files in the %%SystemRoot%%\system32\wins directory
       Note: if wins database file (typically named wins.mdb) is not in the 
       above directory, check the registry for the full filepath. 
       Delete the .mdb file. 
       Note: if jet*.log are not in the above directory, check the registry 
       for the directory path. Delete all log files 

 2) net start wins

Please click on OK to terminate WINS.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Error SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_DB_CONV_GUIDE
Language=English
WINS could not come up because the existent database needs conversion to NT 
SUR format. If this is the first invocation of WINS after an upgrade from 
NT3.51, you need to run the convert utility (upg351db.exe in the 
winnt\system32 directory) on the wins db to convert it to the new improved 
database format. Once you have done that, you should restart WINS.  Please 
click on OK to terminate WINS. This is required for the database conversion 
to succeed. 
.

MessageId= Facility=Wins Severity=Error SymbolicName=WINS_EVT_TEMP_TERM_UNTIL_CONV Language=English
WINS can not come up because the existent database needs conversion to NT 
SUR format.  WINS has initiated the conversion via a process (jetconv).  Once 
the conversion is complete, WINS will get started automatically.  Do not
reboot or kill the jetconv process.  The conversion may take anywhere from a 
few minutes to around an hour (depending on the size of the databases).  
Please terminate WINS now by clicking on OK. This is required for the 
database conversion to succeed. 

NOTE: THE WINS SERVICE WILL START AUTOMATICALLY AFTER THE CONVERSION IS 
SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED.  CHECK THE APPLICATION LOG TO SEE THE STATUS OF THE
CONVERSION FOR WINS DB.
