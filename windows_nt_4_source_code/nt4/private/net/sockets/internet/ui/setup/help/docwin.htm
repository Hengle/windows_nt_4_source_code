<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Document Windows</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><A NAME="TOP"></A><H1>Document Windows</H1>Document windows are where HTML and text files are displayed. You canopen multiple document windows and interact with each windowindependently. For example, you can read a document while downloadingfiles in other windows.<P>When you download a document, the text is displayed immediately as itarrives to your computer. After all of the text arrives, images areloaded. You can scroll text and click on links before the entiredocument is loaded. If you click a link before the entire document isloaded, the current document will be cancelled and the new documentwill be downloaded in the same window.<HR><H2>Graphical Elements of a Document Window</H2><H3>Title Bar</H3>The <B>title bar</B> contains the title of the document in the window.The title bar also contains the Control-menu box (left) and theMaximize and Minimize buttons. <P><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="title.gif"WIDTH=640 HEIGHT=19 ALT="Title bar"><H3>Menu Bar</H3>Descriptions of <A HREF="menus.htm#TOP">menu commands</A> are available.<P><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="menubar.gif" WIDTH=640 HEIGHT=20 ALT="Menu bar"><H3>Toolbar</H3><A HREF="toolbar.htm#TOP">Toolbar buttons</A> provide quick access tofrequently used menu commands.<P><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="toolbar.gif" WIDTH=640 HEIGHT=34 ALT="Toolbar"><H3>Navigation Bar</H3>The navigation bar contains the <B>Back</B> and <B>Forward</B> buttons,the <B>URL field</B>, and the <B>activity indicator</B> (or spinning globe).<P><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="navbar.gif" WIDTH=640 HEIGHT=39 ALT="Navigation bar"><P>The <B>Back</B> button returns to the previous file.
