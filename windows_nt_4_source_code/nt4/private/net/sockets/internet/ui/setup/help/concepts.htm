<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Concepts</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><A NAME="TOP"></A><H1>Mosaic and the World Wide Web</H1>Though there are many ways to find and use information on the Internet,Mosaic is unique in that it is designed to work with the <AHREF="http://www.w3.org/">World WideWeb</A> (WWW).<P>Like other Internet components, the WWW is an information-sharingsystem that allows files to be stored on and retrieved from serversalong the network. Unlike other Internet components, the WWW uses thepowerful information technology called hypermedia.<P>On the WWW, hypermedia works as follows: Every document has a uniqueaddress, much like a telephone number, called a Uniform ResourceLocator (or <A HREF="url.htm">URL</A>). WWW documents can containhyperlinks that point to the URLs of other files. The URL of the fileyou are reading, for example, is in the URL field above this window.<P>The beauty of Mosaic, however, is that it allows you to explore theWWW interactively by simply clicking on hyperlinks. For example, a fileon British literature can link the word "Shakespeare" to a documentlisting the writer's work by title. Each title in that document could,in turn, be linked to a complete work.<P>Exploring is the best way to become acquainted with the WWW. To startyour journey, a list of suggested <A HREF="sampler.htm">startingpoints</A> is available.<HR><A HREF = "topics.htm">Help Contents</A> | <A HREF="index.htm#TOP">Index</A></BODY></HTML>
