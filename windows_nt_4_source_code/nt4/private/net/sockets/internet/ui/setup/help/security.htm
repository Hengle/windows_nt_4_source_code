Sincedifferent applications (banking, education, etc.) require differentlevels of security, multiple security modules may be installed. Once asecurity module is installed, it is ready to use.<P>When Mosaic accesses a secure server, it activates the securitymodule required by that server. If the required module is not installedon your system, you will need to obtain the correct module. Securitymodules and instructions for installing and configuring modules shouldbe available from servers that require that module.<P><B>To list the security modules installed on your system:</B><P><UL><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Security.<P>The following modules are pre-installed:<UL><P><LI>First Virtual<BR>Supports an Internet payment system from <AHREF="http://www.fv.com/">First Virtual Holdings Inc.</A><P><LI>Digest Authentication<BR>Uses MD5-encrypted passwords for authorization to receive an HTTPreply.<P><LI>Basic Authentication<BR>A basic, non-secure protocol supported by nearly all WWW servers. Auser name and password are sent to the server in UUENCODED form. Thismethod can be used to limit access to a server.</UL></UL><P>More information about Mosaic's <AHREF="http://www.spyglass.com/techreport/secframe.htm">securityframework</A> is available.<HR><A HREF = "topics.htm">Help Contents</A> | <A HREF="index.htm#TOP">Index</A></BODY></HTML>
