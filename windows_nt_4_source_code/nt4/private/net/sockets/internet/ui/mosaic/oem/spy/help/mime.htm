<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>MIME</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><A NAME="TOP"></A><H1>MIME</H1>MIME (or Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is a standard forsending multimedia file types by e-mail. File types areidentified by their MIME type, a value that specifies the type and subtype of the data.For example, the MIME type used to identify JPEG files is<I>image/jpeg</I>.<P>MIME type information is included with most files sent over theInternet. This information is used by Mosaic to determine the type offile. If a MIME type is not provided, Mosaic uses the file extension todetermine the file type. After determining the file type, Mosaic eitherhandles the file type internally or sends the file to the appropriatehelper application.<P>If Mosaic cannot handle the file type and an appropriate helperapplication is not available, the  Unhandled File Type dialog isdisplayed. This dialog allows you to save the file without viewing it;configure a helper application and view the file; or cancel the filetransfer.<P><B>To determine the MIME type for a given file type:</B><P><OL><LI>Open the list of <AHREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/media-types">registeredMIME types</A>.<P><LI>Choose the MIME type that best describes the file type.<P><LI>If none of the registered MIME types describe the file type, youcan define your own MIME type/subtype. For the <I>type</I> partof the MIME type, use one of the following types:<UL><P><LI>text<LI>multipart<LI>message <LI>application <LI>image<LI>audio <LI>video </UL><P>If none of these types describe the file type, use the <I>application</I> type.<P><LI>Use your own description for the <I>subtype</I>. To distinguishyour subtype from registered subtypes, type "x-" before thesubtype. For example: application/x-acad</OL><P>Additional information:<P><UL><LI><A HREF="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/mail/mime-faq/top.html">MIME FAQ</A><LI><A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/rfc1521.txt">Technicaloverview of MIME (RFC 1521)</A><LI><A HREF="http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1590.txt">MIME type registrationprocedure</A> </UL><HR><A HREF = "topics.htm">Help Contents</A> | <A HREF="index.htm#TOP">Index</A></BODY></HTML>
