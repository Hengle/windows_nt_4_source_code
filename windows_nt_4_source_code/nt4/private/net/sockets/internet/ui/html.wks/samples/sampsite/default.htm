Microsoft&#174; Peer Web Services for Windows NT&#174; Workstation provides
the ability to do small-scale Web publishing on a company intranet.
Using Peer Web Services, it is not necessary to set up a
dedicated workstation for Web page publishing.
Rather, Peer Web Services runs concurrently with 
desktop applications such as word processors and spreadsheets.
It is ideal for publishing personal and departmental Web pages
on an Intranet.
Should higher-volume Web publishing be required, a dedicated computer running Windows NT Server and Internet Information Server should be used.
<P>

Two Web page samples are included:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="/samples/sampsite/coffee.htm"><B>Departmental Web Page</B></A> -
This example illustrates how Peer Web Services might be used
in a departmental-level situation. In this case, the person
responsible for reporting bean harvest at the Volcano Coffee Company
publishes the information on her own computer for others within her
company to peruse.
<P>

<LI><A HREF="/samples/sampsite/personal.htm"><B>Personal Web Page</B></A> -
This example shows how a user might publish a personal home page by using Peer Web Services.
