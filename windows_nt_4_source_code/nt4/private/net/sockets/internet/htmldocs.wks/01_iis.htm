This chapter will help you quickly and easily install Microsoft Peer Web Services for Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation. 
<P>All you need to do is connect your Windows&nbsp;NT&#150;based computer to the Internet or your intranet (your local or wide area network), install Microsoft Peer Web Services<b> </b>software and specify your home directory. This chapter tells you how.
<P><hr> <font color=#993333><b>Important&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font>To publish on the World Wide Web (WWW) and the Internet, you must contact an Internet Service Provider (ISP) to obtain an Internet connection. Your ISP will provide your server&#146;s Internet Protocol (IP) address, subnet mask, and the default gateway&#146;s IP address. (The default gateway is the computer through which your computer will route all Internet traffic.)
<hr>
<p><!--Heading 1--><h1><A HREF="#ChapTocTop" ><IMG SRC="up.GIF" ALT="To Top" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER=0></A><a name="1h1"> Installation Overview </a> </h1>Once you have installed Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, you can install Peer Web Services from the Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation compact disc. If you already have the necessary Internet or intranet connection, you can accept all of the default settings during setup and then add your Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) content files to the Wwwroot folder. Your files will be immediately available to users. The default setup configurations are suitable for many publishing scenarios without any further modifications.
<P>This section defines the installation requirements and explains how to:
<ul>
<LI> Configure Windows&nbsp;NT before installation.
<P>
<LI> Run the Setup program.
<P>
<LI> Set up files to publish.
<P>
<LI> Test your installation.
</ul><!--Leh--><!--Heading 2--><h2><a name="1h1 1h2"> Installation Requirements </a> </h2>Microsoft Peer Web Services requires:
<ul>
<LI> A computer with at least the minimum configuration to support Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation; see &#147;Windows&nbsp;NT Configuration and Security Checklists,&#148; later in this chapter.
<P>
<LI> Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation version 4.0.
</ul><!--Nsi--><UL><UL><b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>You can administer a server running Peer Web Services<b> </b>from a remote computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation. Install the Peer Web Services Internet Service Manager on that computer, and then connect to the server you want to administer.
<!--Nei--></UL></UL><UL>
<LI> Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) (included with Windows&nbsp;NT). Use the Network application in Control Panel to install and configure the TCP/IP protocol and related components.
<P>
<LI> A CD-ROM drive for the installation compact disc.
<P>
<LI> Adequate disk space for your information content. It is recommended that all drives used with Microsoft Peer Web Services be formatted with the Windows&nbsp;NT File System (NTFS).
</ul><!--Leh--><!--Proch--><h4> To publish on an intranet, you will need </h4><UL>
<LI> A network adapter card and local area network (LAN) connection.
<P>
<LI> The Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) server or the Domain Name System (DNS) server installed on a computer in your intranet. This step is optional, but it does allow users to use &#147;friendly names&#148; instead of IP addresses.
</ul><!--Leh--><!--Proch--><h4> To publish on the Internet, you will need </h4><UL>
<LI> An Internet connection and Internet Protocol (IP) address from your Internet Service Provider (ISP).
<P>
<LI> DNS registration for that IP address. This step is optional, but it does allow users to use &#147;friendly names&#148; instead of IP addresses when connecting to your server. For example, microsoft.com is the domain name registered to Microsoft. Within the microsoft.com domain, Microsoft has named its World Wide Web (WWW) server www.microsoft.com. Most ISPs can register your domain names for you.
<P>
<LI> A network adapter card suitable for your connection to the Internet.
</ul><!--Leh--><!--Heading 2--><h2><a name="1h1 2h2"> Windows&nbsp;NT Configuration and Security Checklists </a> </h2>You must configure the Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation networking component so that your Web server can operate on the network. Microsoft recommends that you also enhance the Windows&nbsp;NT default security settings and implement other Windows&nbsp;NT security measures to prevent users from tampering with your computer or network. For more information about security, see Chapter 5, &#147;<a href="05_iis.htm">Securing Your Site Against Intruders</a>.&#148;
<P><!--Heading 3--><h3><a name="1h1 2h2 1h3"> Windows&nbsp;NT Configuration Checklist </a> </h3>Use the Network application in Control Panel for all configuration tasks mentioned in this section.
<ul>
<LI> <b>Obtain an Internet Connection. </b>Although Peer Web Services is designed mainly for publishing on a corporate intranet, you can set up a low-volume Web site on the Internet for testing or for light use. To publish on the Internet, you must have a connection to the Internet from an ISP. To find an ISP, look in the telephone book under Computers-Networking or in your local newspaper&#146;s business or technology section.
</ul><!--Nsi--><UL><UL><b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>If you want to set up a full-capacity Web site on a dedicated server, you should use Microsoft Internet Information Server running on Windows&nbsp;NT Server version 4.0.
<!--Nei--></UL></UL><UL>
<LI> <b>Install Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation. </b>Install Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Microsoft Peer Web Services.
<P>
<LI> <b>Configure the TCP/IP Protocol. </b>Install the Windows&nbsp;NT TCP/IP Protocol and Connectivity Utilities. If you are making your computer accessible from the Internet, your ISP must provide your server&#146;s IP address, subnet mask, and the default gateway&#146;s IP address. (The default gateway is the ISP computer through which your computer will route all Internet traffic.)
</ul><!--Nsi--><UL><UL><b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>If the FTP service provided with Windows&nbsp;NT has been installed, remove it. Also remove any other previously installed Internet services.
<!--Nei--></UL></UL><UL>
<LI> <b>Configure the Site&#146;s Domain Name</b> (also called Host Name). On the Internet, your IP address (for example, http://10.138.59.1/homepage.htm) can always be used to contact your Web server. However, if you register a domain name in the DNS, your server can be contacted by using a &#147;friendly&#148; domain name (for example, http://www.company.com/homepage.htm). ISPs can usually register domain names for you.
<P>
<LI> <b>Configure Name Resolution.</b> You need a name resolution system to map IP addresses to computer names or domain names. On the Internet, Web sites usually use the Domain Name System. Once you have registered a domain name for your site, users can type your site&#146;s domain name in a browser to contact your site. ISPs can register domain names for you.
</ul><ul><ul>On an intranet, you can use either DNS or the Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). Your network must have DNS or WINS servers to match IP addresses to host names, and client computers must know the IP address of the DNS or WINS server to contact. </UL></UL>
<ul><LI>An alternative to DNS is to use a HOSTS file. On intranets an alternative to WINS Servers is to use an LMHOSTS file. Use the Network application in Control Panel to make the appropriate Advanced TCP/IP Configuration setting for this computer&#146;s name resolution. For more information on installing and configuring WINS or DNS, see the Windows NT online Help.

<hr>
<ul>
<LI> Check permissions on network shares.
</ul><!--Leh--><!--Heading 2--><h2><a name="1h1 3h2"> Before Installing Peer Web Services   </a> </h2>Before installing the Peer Web Services, disable any other Internet services.
<P>If your computer has another version of File Transfer Protocol (FTP), gopher, or World Wide Web (WWW) services installed (such as the FTP service included with Windows&nbsp;NT or the European Microsoft Windows Academic Centre [EMWAC] services included in the Windows&nbsp;NT Resource Kit), disable these services before you install the Microsoft Peer Web Services. See the documentation for each service to see how to disable it.
<P><!--Heading 2--><h2><a name="1h1 4h2"> FTP Guest Account Access </a> </h2>During the setup process, a screen will appear, asking you whether you want to disable access by the Guest account to your FTP server.
<P>Microsoft recommends that you select <b>Yes</b> to protect the contents of your system. If you choose the <b>No</b> option and enable guest access to your server, all existing files and any new files will be available to the Guest account through FTP. You will need to disable access to each file or folder individually to prevent unauthorized access. Disabling FTP access for the Guest account will not affect the IUSR_<i>computername</i> account that is created during setup.
<P><!--Heading 2--><h2><a name="1h1 5h2"> Administrator Privileges Required </a> </h2>To install the services<b> </b>for Peer Web Services, you must be logged on to your computer with administrator privileges. You also need administrator privileges to configure the services remotely through Internet Service Manager.
<P><!--Heading 2--><h2><a name="1h1 6h2"> Installation Folder </a> </h2>By default, Peer Web Services is installed from the compact disc to C:\Winnt\System32\Inetsrv. If you change the default, be sure to enter a fully qualified path name, including a drive letter. Relative paths and paths without drive letters can be misinterpreted by Setup.
<P><!--Heading 2--><h2><a name="1h1 7h2"> Remove All Button </a> </h2>When setting up a new version of Peer Web Services from your computer, click the <b>Remove All</b> button to delete the previous version.

<P><!--Heading 3--><h3><a name="1h1 7h2 1h3"> Event Log Availability </a> </h3>If you remove Peer Web Services, you will be unable to review PWS events in the Event Log.
<P><!--Heading 3--><h3><a name="1h1 7h2 2h3"> Content Folders and Files </a> </h3>The <b>Remove All</b> button in Setup removes all Peer Web Services<b> </b>program files but does not remove the directory structure or any content or sample files. This setting protects your content files from unintentional deletion. If you want to remove these folders and files after completing the Remove All process, delete them by using Windows&nbsp;NT Explorer.
<P><!--Heading 2--><h2><a name="1h1 8h2"> Converting 16-Bit ODBC Drivers to 32-Bit during Setup </a> </h2>If there are data sources referring to 16-bit Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) drivers on the system, Setup will detect them and ask you if you want to convert them to 32-bit. If you choose <b>Yes</b>, these data sources will be converted to refer to the 32-bit ODBC drivers. 
<P><!--Heading 1--><hr><h1><A HREF="#ChapTocTop" ><IMG SRC="up.GIF" ALT="To Top" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER=0></A><a name="2h1"> Installing Peer Web Services </a> </h1>Once you have your network connection and have configured Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, you can install Microsoft Peer Web Services.

<P><!--Le-->
<BR>This final step completes Peer Web Services Setup. Now you must close the <b>Services</b> property sheet and restart your computer for the changes to take effect. 
<P>The preceding steps are all that is required for a simple installation. You are now ready to publish on the Internet or your intranet. There is no need to start Internet Service Manager unless you want to make advanced configuration changes. (If so, refer to Chapter 3, &#147;<a href="03_iis.htm">Configuring and Managing Peer Web Services</a>.&#148;) Use the Services application in Control Panel to confirm successful installation of the publishing services. 
<P><!--Heading 2--><h2><a name="2h1 2h2"> The IUSR_<i>computername</i> Account </a> </h2>Setup automatically creates an anonymous account called IUSR_<i>computername</i>. This account has a randomly generated password and privilege to log on locally. On domain controllers, this account is added to the domain database. This process is fully automatic. After installation is complete, you can change the user name and password for this account from the <b>Service</b> property sheet in Internet Service Manager, as long as the new user name and password match the same user name and password in the Windows&nbsp;NT User Manager.
<P><!--Ns--><b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>If you change the anonymous user name account (IUSR_<i>computername</i>) in the Windows&nbsp;NT User Manager, Microsoft suggests you copy the IUSR_<i>computername</i> account and then give it a new name and password, rather than create an entirely new account. By copying the IUSR_<i>computername</i> account you are sure to carry over all the privileges and user rights granted to that account. Then change the anonymous user name and password in the Internet Service Manager, making sure it is the exactly same as the new user name and password created in the User Manager.
<P><!--Ne-->The WWW, FTP, and gopher services use the IUSR_<i>computername</i> user account by default when anonymous access is allowed. To set the rights for IUSR_<i>computername</i>, use User Manager. To set file permissions on NTFS drives for IUSR_<i>computername</i>, use Windows&nbsp;NT Explorer. To change the account used for anonymous logons for any of the Internet Services, select the <b>Service Properties</b> option from the <b>Properties</b> menu in Internet Service Manager.
<P><!--Heading 1--><hr><h1><A HREF="#ChapTocTop" ><IMG SRC="up.GIF" ALT="To Top" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER=0></A><a name="3h1"> How to Publish Information </a> </h1>Now that Microsoft Peer Web Services is installed and running, you are ready to publish on your intranet. Publishing information with Peer Web Services is easy. If your files are in HTML format, just add them to the appropriate home directory. For example, to make files available to a Web browser using the WWW service, place the files in the Wwwroot folder.
<P>For more extensive information on creating and publishing content files, see Chapter 8, &#147;<a href="08_iis.htm">Publishing Information and Applications</a>.&#148; Note that you can also create and publish highly interactive systems by writing programs that use ISAPI.
<P><!--Ns--><b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>If you provide files with the gopher or FTP services, you can share those files instantly. Users can navigate through the files much as they do in Windows&nbsp;NT Explorer or at the command prompt. With gopher, you can customize how your folders and files appear to browsers; you can also include links to other servers in your files. FTP can be used to accept files from or send files to Internet users.
<P><!--Ne--><!--Heading 2--><h2><a name="3h1 1h2"> Attempting to Publish from Redirected Network Drives </a> </h2>The FTP, gopher, and WWW services cannot publish from redirected network drives (that is, from drive letters assigned to network shared folders). To use network drives, you must use the server and share name (for example, \\<i>Computername</i>\<i>Sharename</i>\<i>Wwwfiles</i>). If you require a user name and password to connect to a network drive, all requests from remote users to access that drive must be made with the user name and password you specified, not the anonymous IUSR_<i>computername</i> account or another account you may have specified.
<P>Consider security issues carefully when using this feature. Remote users could possibly make changes to a network drive by using the permissions of the user name specified to connect to the network drive.
<P><!--Ns--><b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>With Peer Web Services you can publish only from network drives that are within the same domain or trusted domain of the Peer Web Service server.
<P><!--Ne--><!--Heading 3--><h3><a name="3h1 1h2 3h3"> Default.htm and the Peer Web Services Home Page  </a> </h3>By default, Peer Web Services uses a file named Default.htm as the home page for the various samples, tools, and demonstrations that come with the product. If the Wwwroot folder of your Web server already contains a file named Default.htm when you install<b> </b>Peer Web Services, your file will not be overwritten with our file. As a result, you will not have immediate access to our sample home page and the links it provides when you run Peer Web Services.
<P>In this case, to view our version of Default.htm and the links it provides, type the following Uniform Resource Locator (URL) in the Internet Explorer <b>Address</b> box.
<P><b>http://</b><i><B>computername</b></i><b>/samples/default.htm</b>
<P>This command loads the file Default.htm from the Wwwroot\Samples folder.
<P>You can also rename or move your version of Default.htm to a different folder and then copy the file Default.htm from the Samples folder. This approach will make our version of Default.htm your Web server&#146;s home page.
<P><!--Heading 2--><h2><a name="3h1 2h2"> How to Test Your Peer Web Services Installation </a> </h2>You can test your installation by using Internet Explorer to view the files in your home directory.
<P><!--Proch--><h4> To test a Web server connected to the Internet </h4><ul><b> 1.</b> Ensure that your Web server has HTML files in the Wwwroot folder.
