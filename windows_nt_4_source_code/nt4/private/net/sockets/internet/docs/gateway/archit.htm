<H1>Internet Access Gateway Service Architecture</H1>

<P>
The illustration below shows how the Internet Access Gateway service
works:
<P>
<IMG SRC="archit1.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 
<P>
The Windows NT Server-based computer running the Internet Access
Gateway service has at least two network adapter cards: one for
your local area network and the other for the Internet. The card
connected to your network uses Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and
at least one network transport protocol, such as TCP/IP, IPX/SPX,
or NetBEUI. The card connected to the Internet should be bound
to TCP/IP only.
<P>
Client requests and responses are transported across client desktops
and the Internet Access Gateway service using Remote Procedure
Call (RPC) which provides transport-protocol independence and
user-level authentication. <A NAME="DDE_LINK1"></A><A NAME="DDE_LINK2"></A>The
Internet Access Gateway service acts as a policy manager and protocol
translator. Converting the application requests received from
your Windows client into the Internet's TCP/IP protocol, it establishes
a TCP/IP connection to the specified Internet server and sends
the client's request. The Internet Access Gateway service accepts
only those incoming Internet packets received through such a connection.
It ignores all other incoming Internet IP packets.
<P>
To use the available Internet resources effectively and enhance
the client Internet access performance, the gateway server caches
the Internet information in local storage. If another client requests
information that is already in the cache, it is retrieved from
there and returned to the client. Caching reduces the Internet
traffic and allows for quicker response time for client requests.
Caching is particularly useful for small businesses that have
slower links to the Internet and whose clients access the same
Internet resources.
<P>
This illustration shows the Internet Access Gateway service in
greater detail:

The client labeled C1 uses the CERN-compatible proxy gateway feature
of the Internet Access Gateway service to access the Internet.
The advantages of the CERN-compatible proxy gateway feature are
that you can access the Internet from a client on any platform
running a browser application that provides CERN proxy support.
However, the CERN-compatible proxy gateway supports the TCP/IP
protocol only, and it does not provide per-user rights policy
control.
<P>
The client labeled C2 is a Win32 (or Win32s) client that uses
the advanced features of the Internet Access Gateway service to
access the Internet. This client can be running any RPC-compatible
transport protocol, such as IPX/SPX, TCP/IP or NetBEUI. The client
communicates with the Internet Access Gateway service by using
the transport-independent RPC mechanism. The CERN proxy support
built into the client's browser is used to redirect the browser's
Windows Sockets requests to the Access Gateway Provider. The Access
Gateway Provider then translates these requests into Internet
Extensions for Win32. The Internet Extensions for Win32 on the
client computer are configured to forward the requests to the
Internet Access Gateway service via RPC. The Internet Access Gateway
service processes the client requests by calling the Internet
Extensions for Win32. On the Internet Access Gateway computer
the Internet Extensions for Win32 use Windows Sockets over TCP/IP
to communicate directly on the Internet. This mechanism offers
advanced security features such as per-user rights policy control
and Windows NT security integration. This client can be running
Windows NT Workstation, Windows 95, Windows for Workgroups, or
Windows version 3.1.
<P>
The client labeled C3 is also a Win32 (or Win32S) client that
uses the advanced features of the Internet Access Gateway service
to access the Internet. However, this client runs a browser application
that supports the Internet Extensions for Win32 directly, and
therefore does not require the Access Gateway Provider component.
