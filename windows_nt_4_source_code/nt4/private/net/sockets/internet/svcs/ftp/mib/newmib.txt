Steps required to make a new MIB based on the FTP MIB:

1. Rename FTPMIB.DEF to {component}MIB.DEF

2. Edit {component}MIB.DEF to contain the correct component name
   and description.

3. Edit MAIN.C to create & destroy the appropriate statistics structure
   in SnmpExtensionQuery().

4. Edit MIB.H to #include the correct header files.

5. Edit MIB.RC to contain the correct versioning information.

6. Edit SOURCES to build the correct DLL.

7. Make the following changes to MIB.C:

        1. Edit the MIB_ENTRY_ITEM macro to use the appropriate
           statistics structure.

        2. Edit the OID_Prefix variable to contain the correct
           MIB OID for the new component.

        3. Edit the OID definitions (the MIB_* globals) to contain
           the correct MIB variables for the new component.

        4. Edit the Mib[] MIB_ENTRY array to contain one entry for
           each MIB_* global.

8. Rebuild everything. You should be done.
