Date        Details
--------    -------

03/08/93    Starting coding.

07/30/93    Initial release, part of Windows NT Product 1.0.

09/10/93    Fixed problem with aggressive client firewalls refusing
            connections from sockets bound to nonreserved ports.
            QFE Bug #3633.

09/13/94    Added integrated path canonicalization code so that I could
            remove the "lock/chdir/fileopen/unlock" crap that was such
            a huge bottleneck on MP machines. For Power PC release.

12/06/94    If user doesn't specify a domain name, pass the local machine's
            primary domain into LsaLogonUser. Previous versions would pass
            in an empty string, which would cause LSA to search for known
            accounts, which is NOT what we want it to do.

08/15/95    Initial Beta for Gibraltar High-Performance FTP server (MuraliK)
