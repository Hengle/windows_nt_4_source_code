Contents:

1. ISVC_INFO
2. Eventlog
3. RequestLog


1. ISVC_INFO:
        This is the common base class for all the Internet services. It
consists of information that is generic to all the services. The data consists
of 
  Supplied Data:
        ServiceName
        ServiceId
        Registry key name for parameters of service
        Module Name ( the dll name of service for resources)

  Internal Data:
        EventLog object
        Request Log Oject (InetLog)
        ModuleHandle
        fValid -- indicating if this object is valid
        tsLock -- resource lock
        AdminName name of administrator  (from registry)
        AdminEmail email for administrator (from registry)
        AdminComment comment about this server (from registry)


 From the ISVC_INFO object we derive two kinds of objects
        IGSVC_INFO  -- Internet Gateway service info object
        IPSVC_INFO  -- Internet Publishing service info object
  ( At present IPSVC_INFO is also called TSVC_INFO (old name))

 IPSVC_INFO:
        This object consists of common information for all Internet Publishing
services. Currently the services include Gopher, FTP and WWW services. The
data maintained by this object includes all those in ISVC_INFO and the
following:
  Supplied Data:
        Anonymous User Name
        Anonymous Password Secret Name
        Virtual Roots Secret Name
        Function pointer for initialization of service
        Function pointer for cleanup of service on termination
        
  Internal Data:
        fValid -- if this object is valid
        AnonymousUserToken
        tsCache - cache object for cached objects
        Accept IP address list ( from registry)
        Deny IP address list (from registry)
