1. Multiple Volumes


1. Multiple Volumes     ( 25/Oct/94)
--------------------

  It is required that Gopher server supports multiple volumes spanning disk 
boundaries. Unfortunately in current OS implementations ( NT 3.5, Win3.1,
Windows 95 etc), each volume is limited by the size of the disk partition which
is limited by size of a disk ( typically 1-10 GB). In addition providing
multiple volumes ensures a single server to access data from multiple volumes
across network to serve off to clients. In UNIX however, use of symbolic and 
hard links provide an elegant solution couple with mounting of disks
as directories to provide multiple volumes. 

 Our approach to provide multiple volumes is based on virtual links. The 
Administrator establishes a mapping between the virtual volume names and 
the actual paths ( absolute paths) for each volume. The server uses this
mapping to establish a correspondence between the virtual path and absolute
path to retrieve files or directory information. The menu listings handed
out by Gopher server to clients uses virutal names. On a request from client
the server first maps the virutal name to absolute path before accessing 
the data.

 The server configuration includes following parameters:
1. mapping of virtual names to absolute paths
2. a specific virtual name designated as the home for the server. This will be
  used as the default volume when we receive a null-request ( which most gopher
  clients use when they startup a session with new host).

 In this implementation, both above parameters are stord in GSERVER_CONFIG
object. Following functions are used for mapping:
  GetAbsoluteVolume()  converts a virtual volume into absolute path.
  GetVirtualHomeVolume()  returns the home volume of server
