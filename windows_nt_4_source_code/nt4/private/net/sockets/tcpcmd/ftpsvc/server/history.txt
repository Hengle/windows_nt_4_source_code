Date        Details
--------    -------

03/08/93    Starting coding.

07/30/93    Initial release, part of Windows NT Product 1.0.

09/10/93    Fixed problem with aggressive client firewalls refusing
            connections from sockets bound to nonreserved ports.
            QFE Bug #3633.

09/13/94    Added integrated path canonicalization code so that I could
            remove the "lock/chdir/fileopen/unlock" crap that was such
            a huge bottleneck on MP machines. For Power PC release.

12/06/94    If user doesn't specify a domain name, pass the local machine's
            primary domain into LsaLogonUser. Previous versions would pass
            in an empty string, which would cause LSA to search for known
            accounts, which is NOT what we want it to do.

07/21/95    QFE fix for ftp.microsoft.com. Fixes socket leak caused by
            multiple redundant PASV commands. Avoids grabbing statistics
            lock whenever possible. Avoids calls to fopen() for annotation
            files whenever file is known to not exist.
