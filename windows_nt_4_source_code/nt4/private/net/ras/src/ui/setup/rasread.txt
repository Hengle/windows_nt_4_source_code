GENERAL NOTES
=================================================

Starting the Remote Access Server
---------------------------------
If the Remote Access server fails to start, check the Windows NT Event Viewer for more information.


Browsing Remote Networks
------------------------
To browse a remote network, the remote RAS computer must belong to a workgroup or domain on the network.  If the computer is not a member of a valid workgroup or domain on the network, the remote computer will not be able to browse the network from File Manager. 

Note:  You can still connect to servers directly using File Manager even if your RAS computer is not a member of a valid workgroup or domain. For example, in the File Manager Connect Network Drive dialog box, you can enter a server name and share name and connect to that server and share, even though the server does not appear in the browse box.


RAS Authentication
------------------
When you are dialing a number, the domain name you enter in the Authentication dialog box should be the Windows NT domain that the Windows NT RAS server is in. This is not the DNS domain name given by some PPP/SLIP providers. For example, you would enter accounting, not www.halcyon.com.

Using Winchat with RAS
----------------------
When using WINCHAT.EXE on a remote client, you must change a Registry key on the RAS server.

Using REGEDT32.EXE, change 

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\
  RemoteAccess\Parameters\NetBiosGateway\RemoteListen 

from 1 (the default) to 2.


Registry Key Name Changes and Additions
---------------------------------------
In the Windows NT Server RAS book, in Appendix C, the IPXRouter Parameters section incorrectly refers to the IPXRouter Registry key. The correct key name is NwLnkRip. All other information in the IPXRouter Parameters section is correct. The Registry path for this entry is:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NwLnkRip\Parameters

In Appendix C, in the IP Parameters section, you should change all the parameters in a RAS server's Registry, not a RAS client's Registry. In the NdisWan Parameters section,  disregard paragraphs two and three. In the AsyncMac Parameters section, the XonXoff parameter is no longer a valid parameter.

The following Registry keys are not printed in Appendix C, "Modifying Registry Parameters". For information about each entry, see Remote Access Help.

PPP Subkey IPCP entries:
   AcceptVJCompression
   PriorityBasedOnSubNetwork
   RequestNameServerAddresses
   RequestVJCompression

   InitUIFrames

NwlnkIpx Parameter
   DisableDialinNetbios


RAS Compression
---------------
Support for RAS software compression between Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT has been added.

The formulas used for calculating compression statistics in the Port Status dialog box are different for Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and Windows NT 3.51.

(1)	Bytes Transmitted/Received:
	
	On Windows for Workgroups, the values shown represent the
	number of bytes of data actually transmitted on the wire.
	Thus, 100K of user data that compressed by 40K will show
	as 60K Bytes Transmitted/Received.

	On Windows NT 3.51, the values shown represent the full
	number of bytes transferred.  In this example, 100K.

(2)	Percent of Compression:

	On all platforms RAS compression predetermines what data
	should or should not be compressed for optimal performance.

	On Windows for Workgroups 3.11 the "Compression%" value
	represents the ratio of compression achieved, accounting only
	for that data on which compression was attempted.

	On Windows NT 3.51, the "Compression%" accounts for all data,
	including the data on which compression was not attempted.  As
	a result, the reported "Compression%" figures for Windows NT 3.51
	will run lower than those shown on Windows for Workgroups 3.11.


Remote Access Support for Security Dynamics ACE Server ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Windows NT 3.51 Remote Access has the capability to authenticate dial-in
users using the Security Dynamics ACE Server. To enable authentication with the Security Dynamics ACE Server, you need to install a special module from Security Dynamics Inc. You can reach Security Dynamics Inc. at the following address:

 Security Dynamics  
 One AleWife Center
 Cambridge, MA 02140-2312
 Tel: (617) 547 7820
 Fax: (617) 354 8836
 

Shadow RAM Conflicts
--------------------
Computers that use Shadow RAM may experience problems with memory conflicts. You may need to disable BIOS Shadow RAM using the computer setup program provided by the computer manufacturer. See your computer documentation or manufacturer for more information.


NetBEUI Bindings on Computers with Multiple Network Cards
---------------------------------------------------------
RAS installs NetBEUI by default. If a computer has two network cards, NetBEUI is bound to both cards. This will cause your workstation service not to start due to duplicate computer names on the network. 
So, if your computer has more than one network card and you are installing RAS, during the installation process make sure NetBEUI is bound to only one of the network cards. You can change the bindings in the Network Control Panel icon by choosing the Bindings button in the Network Settings dialog box.
During RAS installation, you can also choose not to install NetBEUI by choosing the Network button in the Remote Access Setup dialog box. In the Network Configuration dialog box, clear the NetBEUI check box. 


Using RAS with PCMCIA Cards
---------------------------
If you are using RAS with a PCMCIA card and are experiencing difficulty with your computer, such as lock-ups or error messages about hardware failure, use the Terminal program in the Program Manager Accessories group to assure that the PCMCIA card is functioning properly. 
If Terminal locks up, the problem could be one of the following:
* The modem is not recognized by Windows NT
* FIFO needs to be disabled
* An incorrect IRQ or I/O address is being used
To reconfigure the communications port, in the Control Panel Ports icon, choose the Settings button, and then choose the Advanced button. Then, in the Registry, add the following entry for the new port key:
Pcmcia:REG_DWORD 1

If Terminal functions properly, verify that the modem type is being detected correctly and that the speed is set correctly. For information on speed settings, refer to the modem manufacturer's manual.



=================================================
CONNECTING TO WINDOWS NT 3.51 RAS SERVERS
WITH THIRD-PARTY PPP CLIENTS
=================================================

NetManage Chameleon and Chameleon NFS Version 4.1 Clients Required
------------------------------------------------------------------
Versions of NetManage Chameleon prior to 4.1 do not interoperate with Windows NT. You must update to version 4.1 to connect to Windows NT 3.51 RAS servers.

Also, you must make the following change in the SLIP.INI file located in the \NETMANAG directory, before connecting a NetManage client to a Windows NT RAS server.

[ppp]
SCRIPT=-n
TYPE=PPP

In order to configure the NetManage client to request an IP address from the Windows NT RAS server, set the client IP address to 0.0.0.0.

If you want the NetManage client to request a specific IP address, you must configure the RAS server IP configuration to allow remote clients to request their own IP addresses. You configure the RAS server using the Network option of Control Panel.


Third-Party FTP Software
------------------------
PC/TCP OnNet version 1.1 or later is required for Windows NT. Previous version of FTP Software Inc. client software do not work with Windows NT.

In order to have the Remote Access server assign an IP address for you, set your IP address to 0.0.0.0 before dialing.  You can set your IP address from the Configure screen of the Dialer application.


Wollongong Software
-------------------
Wollongong PPP software now interoperates with Windows NT 3.51. Contact The Wollongong Group for more information or updates:
The Wollongong Group Inc.

Palo Alto, CA 94303-4310
Tel# (800) 872-8649 


=================================================
CONNECTING TO THIRD-PARTY PPP SERVERS
WITH WINDOWS NT 3.51 RAS CLIENTS
=================================================

Connecting to Internet Service Providers that Use Older PPP Software
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If you connect to an Internet service provider and TCP/IP utilities do not work (such as FTP or TELNET) the problem may be due to Van Jacobson (VJ) header compression and older PPP software on the Internet service provider system. Older PPP server software may be unable to match the VJ header compression settings on your computer.

To solve the problem, you must disable VJ header compression for that entry. To disable VJ header compression, select the entry in your phone book. Choose the Edit button. Choose the Advanced button (if the Network button is not visible). Choose the Network Button. Choose the TCP/IP Settings button. Clear the Use VJ Header Compression check box. Choose the OK button until you return to the main Remote Access dialog box. You should be able to successfully connect to the entry and use TCP/IP utilities.


Cisco Router Software
---------------------
You can use Windows NT RAS to connect through a Cisco router. If you have a Cisco router using version 9.21 or earlier, you must upgrade your Cisco router software to the most recent release. Contact Cisco Systems for more information at 800-553-NETS, or via electronic mail at tac@cisco.com.


3Com Access Builder Software
----------------------------
You can use Windows NT RAS to connect to 3Com Access Builder remote access servers. If you have installed Access Builder products prior to September 1994, you must upgrade your 3Com Access Builder software to the most recent release. Contact your 3Com representative for information about upgrading your Access Builder software. If you do not have a 3Com representative, contact the 3Com Corporation product information line at 800-638-3266. You can also call 408-764-5000 and ask for the product information line.


Using Terminal Mode in RAS
--------------------------
Some Internet providers require new users to register using terminal mode after connecting the first time. Try using the terminal mode provided by Remote Access and select Dumb Terminal from the terminal mode emulations offered at connect time by the Internet provider. If the terminal emulation provided in RAS does not work, use the Terminal program in the Program Manager Accessories group.

RAS AND TCP/IP
=================================================

Resetting DHCP Leases on RAS Servers
------------------------------------
If you configure a new set of IP addresses at the DHCP server and you want RAS servers to re-synchronize with the new DHCP configuration, you must delete the RAS server's DHCP cache and reset the lease on the RAS server. This is accomplished by deleting a Registry key and restarting the Remote Access server, as described below.

At the command prompt, type:

start regedt32.exe

In the \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services
\RemoteAccess\Parameters\IP entry, delete the entire DhcpAddresses key. Restart the Remote Access Server service.



=================================================
RAS AND IPX
=================================================

Using NetBIOS Applications on IPX
------------------------------
RAS supports running NetBIOS applications on IPX. No configuration is necessary if the RAS remote client is the application client and the NetBIOS application server is on the LAN. However, if the NetBIOS application server is the remote computer, you may need to set one or both of the following Registry entries to ensure the IPX type 20 packets used for initial contact between the NetBIOS IPX client and server are forwarded correctly. 

To set where NetBIOS broadcast packets from dial-in lines are broadcast, change the following Registry key:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
\NwlnkIpx\Parameters\DisableDialinNetbios.

To set whether packets are broadcast to or from the LAN through the RAS IPX router, change the following Registry key:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
\NwlnkRip\Parameters\NetbiosRouting. The DisableDialinNetbios parameter must be set correctly in addition to NetbiosRouting.

For more information, see the appropriate Registry topics in Remote Access Help.


Using Shiva Remote Version 3.2 Client Software and IPX
------------------------------------------------------
If you are using the IPX protocol with Shiva remote client software, you must configure the Windows NT 3.51 RAS server IPX settings to allow remote clients to request an IPX node number. You configure the RAS server using the Network option of Control Panel.



=================================================
ISDN
=================================================



Reinstalling RAS with ISDN
--------------------------
If you remove and then reinstall RAS on a computer that was previously configured with RAS and ISDN, you will not be able to add the ISDN ports in RAS setup. You must reconfigure the ISDN driver as follows before reinstalling and reconfiguring RAS with ISDN ports.

Removing and Adding an ISDN Port to RAS Configuration
-----------------------------------------------------
If you remove any non-serial ports from RAS configuration, you must reconfigure the hardware before you add the port back into RAS configuration. For example, suppose you  have RAS configured with COM1 and PcimacISDN1 ports. You remove the PcimacISDN1 port which is the only ISDN port configured, and restart the computer. Now, when you configure RAS, you are not able to add the PcimacISDN1 port. 
To add the ISDN port to RAS configuration, you must reconfigure the ISDN hardware adapter. This ensures that the port information is added back to the Registry and will  enable you to add the removed port to RAS configuration.


Installing a PCIMAC ISDN Card on a Gateway 2000 Pentium
-------------------------------------------------------
You must disable BIOS Shadow RAM of 32K at d0000 on Gateway 2000 Pentium computers when a PCIMAC ISDN card is present and the card's base address is d0000. If you do not disable the BIOS Shadow RAM at d0000, the PCIMAC card appears to initialize correctly but does not work.

To disable BIOS Shadow RAM of 32K at d0000, use the computer setup program by pressing F1 after the memory check, and then choosing Advanced Options. The Disable Shadow RAM and the Shadow RAM Base options appear in this screen.


Installing New Modems with ISDN Cards
-------------------------------------
If you have a laptop computer that uses an ISDN card when plugged into a docking station and you install a new modem while away from the docking station, you must use RAS Setup to add the ISDN ports when you return to the docking station.



=================================================
X.25 NETWORKS
=================================================

Europe:        Eicon Technology Ltd.


Configuring Null Modem Connections on X.25 Networks
---------------------------------------------------
When using a null-modem connection on X.25 networks, the server X.25 port must be set to DCE and the client should be set to DTE. If the port on both computers is set to DTE, you cannot connect.

The X.25 null modem should be configured for DCE and internal clocking before an X.25 null-modem client can connect. To configure the X.25 null modem, in Control Panel choose Network. In the Network Settings dialog box, choose the X.25 card driver in the list of adapters, then choose Configure. Select the null modem port, choose X.25 and change the node type to DCE. Select X.25 and set the clocking to Internal. Save the configuration and restart the system.


Creating Reliable Links Using Dial-up PADs
------------------------------------------
The following is recommended on all workstations that are going to access a dial-up PAD to connect through X.25 to a RAS server using an EiconCard.

Establish all modem connections using a reliable link (either V.42, LAPM, or MNP4) and enable hardware handshaking between your local modem and the workstation. Enable these settings by editing the Remote Access entry's modem settings. Select the check box for modem error correction and the check box for hardware flow control.

Using this feature ensures that there is end-to-end flow control and no data will be lost between the dial-up PAD and the client workstation. You may encounter problems unless these modem settings are made.


Configuring a RAS Server for X.25
-----------------------------------
When configuring a RAS Server to use X.25 over an EiconCard, several steps must be followed to define the number of clients that can connect to the server.

 1. Define the total number of virtual circuits that the EiconCard will be configured for.

    a. Choose the Network option in Control Panel.

    b. In the Network Settings dialog box, select the EiconCard driver in the Installed Adapter Cards box.

    c. Choose the Configure button. 

    d. Follow the instructions in your Eicon WAN Services for Windows NT System Guide on how to configure the total number of virtual circuits.

       The sum of the two-way virtual circuits (TVC) and incoming virtual circuits (IVC) in the X.25 configuration screen must equal the number of incoming X.25 clients the server will support at one time. You may have to find out how many TVCs and IVCs your X.25 line has by contacting your X.25 vendor.

 2. Define the number of communication ports to be available for RAS in the XPAD 
    configuration program.

    a. Choose the Network option in Control Panel.

    b. In the Network Settings dialog box, select the Eicon X.PAD Driver in the
      Installed Network Software box.

    c. Choose the Configure button. 

    d. Configure the total number of COM ports by selecting the COM ports from the Available Ports list and then choosing the Add button.

       It is recommended that the number of communication ports should be equal to the number of virtual circuits (TVC+IVC) configured.

 3. Configure the number of communication ports (Eicon XPAD's) in RAS using the Network option in Control Panel.


X.25 Buffering
--------------
On each communication port in the Eicon PAD configuration, it is recommended that the packet length supported be left at the default of 128.  This will give optimum performance on the server.


Server Bandwidth and the Total Number of Clients
------------------------------------------------
To obtain maximum performance in the RAS clients and to ensure reliable connections, ensure that the aggregate throughput of all clients does not exceed the bandwidth of the RAS server.

For example, four clients running at 2400 bits per second (bps) can be connected to a server with a 9600 bps X.25 line. However, attaching a fifth client at 2400 bps will exceed the server's bandwidth. This will cause all clients to operate at speeds below 2400 bps.  If a virtual circuit, communication port, and RAS port are defined for five ports, then five clients can connect using X.25. However, connecting five clients at one time is not recommended since the throughput of each client will be very low and will cause time-outs in the network protocols running over RAS.


Troubleshooting Remote Disconnections
-------------------------------------
When a client connection is cleared, the system event log of the RAS server running X.25 can be examined for an error message. The event log can record why the remote client or the remote network disconnected.

If the remote client (through a dial-up PAD or local PAD) disconnects, the following warning message will appear in the system event log.

"Remote DTE cleared the X.25 call on XPADxxx, X.25 Return Codes: Cause yy (hex) Diagnostic yy (hex)"

The "XPADxxx" is the port name defined in the XPAD configuration.  "yy" is a hex string.  For DTE clearing the cause will always be 00.  The Diagnostic code can be 00--indicating that the remote client requested a disconnect--or another non-zero value.  When the diagnostic code is non-zero it indicates a clearing due to the remote client's dial-up PAD service.  Contact the remote client's X.25 service provider to determine the problem.

If the X.25 network disconnects, the following warning message will appear in the system event log.

"Network cleared the X.25 call on XPADxxx, X.25 Return Codes: Cause yy (hex) Diagnostic yy (hex)"

The "XPADxxx" is the port name defined in the XPAD configuration.  "yy" is a hex string.  For a network clearing the cause value will always be a non-zero value.  The diagnostic code in the cause can be any value. Consult your local X.25 service provider with the cause and diagnostic value to determine the exact reason for the network disconnect.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
=================================================
This section contains questions and answers from public bulletin boards, such as CompuServe. It is included to help customers with similiar questions.
You can find more information in the RAS online Help file or in Microsoft's whitepaper on RAS located on ftp.microsoft.com or www.microsoft.com.

QUESTION:
I had my DHCP server configured for an address pool.  I then
changed it to a different pool.  Now all my RAS clients continue to get addresses from the initial pool.  Why?

ANSWER:
See the section, "Resetting DHCP Leases on RAS Servers" earlier in this file.

---------------------------------------------------
QUESTION:
My site has a Shiva network modem which I can use to call into and 
establish a connection on the Novell network. Can I use the RAS client software to dial in and establish a connection directly with Shiva, without having to setup a Windows NT Server computer as a RAS server? If so, how would I go about doing this?

ANSWER:
The Windows NT RAS client will dial into a Shiva network modem.  You
need to install RAS on the Windows NT client.  Then dial in using a valid username and password.  

If you have problems, there are many things to check.  You can check to see if the client is requesting its own IP address, but the server is not configured to supply one.  Also, you must select PPP protocols that are supported on the server; for example, IP or IPX.

------------------------------------------
QUESTION:
I have an internal Intel SatisFAXtion/400 modem, which is installed on COM4.
When I try to setup RAS for this modem, it only lists Port 2 and Port 3 as
options.  It says if I want to access other ports to get a driver from the
manufacturer.  Does this mean that I need a SatisFAXtion driver for Windows NT from Intel?

ANSWER:
This means you probably do not have the modem configured correctly for COM4. The system is not recognizing a device on COM4, so COM4 is not being offered in RAS setup.  Try using Terminal to dial out through COM4. If the modem is correctly configured for COM4, you may have an IRQ conflict that is causing the problem.  Check the Windows NT Event Viewer to see if there are any
problems listed there.

---------------------------------------------------
QUESTION:
Does anyone have a fix for the SMC 16550 UART.... I get error messages when using RAS to connect to a computer above 19200. Is there a fix besides changing my serial card or going to an internal modem?

ANSWER: You can try setting the port speed a bit lower.  This is the speed at which the machine talks to the modem,
rather than the speed of the modem.  By default it is 38400.  Try setting it to the same speed as his modem.  To set this, edit the
phone book entry and choose the Modem button at the bottom of the
dialog.  Select a speed in the Initial Speed (bps) box.

----------------------------------------------------
QUESTION:
How, on a Windows NT Server version 3.5 network, do I provide primary DNS service?  Do I need to put a UNIX box on my LAN just to provide DNS?  Or is there a DNS Server that will run under the Windows NT Services system?

ANSWER:
Windows NT Server version 3.5 does not have a DNS service. A DNS server for Windows NT is available in the Windows NT 3.5 Resource Kit.

---------------------------------------------------
QUESTION:
Are there any plans to provide an upgrade for Windows for Workgroups RAS clients and Windows NT version 3.1 RAS clients so that they will be compatible 
with the new software compression scheme in Windows NT version 3.5?

ANSWER:
Support for Windows for Workgroups 3.11 RAS and Windows NT version 3.1 RAS software compression is available in the Windows NT version 3.51 release.

---------------------------------------------------
QUESTION:
1.  I can successfully connect using RAS on a Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 with a Windows NT Server version 3.1 running RAS.  However, I get the following message in the Connection Information dialog on the Windows NT version 3.5 client: "Using Down-Level RAS Protocol". 

2.  The connection information also shows that I am getting 0% compression. This message occured when I switched from a Windows for Workgroups 3.11 RAS client to a Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 RAS client. Any suggestions for getting my compression back?

ANSWER:
1.  Windows NT version 3.1 RAS does not support PPP, which the Windows NT version 3.5 RAS client is attempting to use when connecting. Windows NT version 3.5 RAS falls back to the older protocol to make the connection and displays the "Using Down-Level RAS Protocol" message.

2.  To get software compression with Windows NT version 3.5 RAS calling a Windows NT version 3.1 RAS server, upgrade your RAS client to Windows NT version 3.51 which supports the older software compression algorithm used in Windows NT version 3.1.

---------------------------------------------------
QUESTION:
Windows NT version 3.5 has PPP/SLIP built into RAS, so you can use the RAS client software to connect your Windows NT computer to the Internet.
Suppose I have a LAN which includes a bunch of Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 systems networked to a system running Windows NT version 3.5. If the Windows NT system uses RAS to connect to an Internet provider, and if I have the TCP/IP protocol on all computers on the LAN, will the Windows NT computer connect the two ends? That is, will it act as a gateway, allowing the Windows for Workgroups computers to see the Internet on the other end of the RAS connection?
If so, is it automatic, or do I have to do something to enable it? If not, is there any way to get this capability?  Is it in Windows NT Server or some third-party product?

ANSWER:
LAN to LAN routing is not supported today.  Look for it in the Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack release in the next few months.
For more information, see the Windows NT 3.5 Resource Kit or the following Knowledge Base article:
Enabling Routing of IP Packets on RAS Clients

QUESTION:
What are all the steps necessary to make a RAS connection from Windows for Workgroups to Windows NT version 3.5 with a null modem setup?

ANSWER:
1.  Install RAS on the RAS server.  Configure it for a null modem, at 9600 bps.
2.  On the RAS server, create an account for the user dialing in.
3.  On the RAS server, in RAS Admin, select the Permissions command under the Users menu. Grant dial-in permission for that user account.
4.  Install RAS on the Windows for Workgroups client.  Configure it for a null modem.
5.  In Remote Access, create a phonebook entry to the server you are dialing.  Enter 1 (or some random number) for the phone number.
6.  Choose the Dial button.  The rest happens exactly like an analog connection.
     Make sure you are using a standard null modem cable. See the RAS on-line Help topic "Cabling Requirements" for details.

QUESTION:
I have TCP/IP installed on both my RAS server and client, but when I dial in, I get an error saying PPP is not installed.

ANSWER:
You need to enable TCP/IP for RAS.
To enable a protocol for RAS, start the Control Panel Network icon.
In the Network Settings dialog box, select Remote Access Service and choose the Configure button. In the Remote Access Setup dialog box, choose the Network button. In the Network Configuration dialog box, make sure the appropriate protocols are checked in the Dial Out Protocols box.

QUESTION:
We would like to use RAS to administer a remote Windows NT Server computer version 3.5 at a client's site. What kind of software do we need to have on our side? Do we need to dial the server from our Windows NT Server computer version 3.5 or can we dial in from any computer?

ANSWER:
This is easiest if you dial them from a Windows NT Server computer. That way all you have to do is run the administrative tools already found on the Windows NT Server computer and point them at the remote client.

You can also install the Windows NT Server tools found on the Windows NT Server CD on a Windows NT Workstation computer. Then you can use that workstation to dial in and manage Windows NT Server computers on the remote network.

To install the Windows NT Server Tools on a computer running Windows NT Workstation, obtain a Windows NT Server CD and run the \CLIENT\SRVTOOLS\WINNT\SETUP.BAT batch file.

There are also Windows NT Server tools for use on computers running MS-DOS 5.0 or later, Windows version 3.1x (with LAN Manager for MS-DOS), or Windows for Workgroups 3.1x.
To install the Windows NT Server Tools obtain a Windows NT Server CD and follow the instructions in the README.TXT file in the \CLIENT\SRVTOOLS\WINDOWS directory.

QUESTION:
Does anyone have any experience tying two Windows NT computers together via null modem?  
I have two computers on my desk running Windows NT 3.5 and I have no other networking 
hardware, so I'm trying to use RAS and my null modem cable to link them together. But, everytime
I try to dial I get a message of hardware failure.
I've checked my cable for continuity, and it matches the table supplied in the Windows NT Help file.  Also, I've tried it with all the modem options (things like "enable hardware flow control")
turned off, as well as with a smattering of them turned on, but to no effect. 

ANSWER:
Are you using a 25-pin to 9-pin converter for either of the COM ports?
If so, make sure it is not the 25-9 adapter that ships with the Microsoft Mouse.  That is not a true converter, and will cause this problem.

If that is not the problem, double check that both client and server have the same speed Null Modem entry selected in the Configure Port dialog in RAS.
Also, make sure you are not using a standard null modem cable. See the RAS on-line Help topic "Cabling Requirements" for details.

---------------------------------------------------
QUESTION:
I was wondering how many RAS connections Windows NT Server version 3.5 supports, and what hardware for these connections was recommended (I.E. Dialogic, etc.).
Also, do you have any additional information on the optimum server (hardware/system) for X+ users?

ANSWER:
The RAS server for Windows NT version 3.5 or later will support up to 256 clients per server. To do that I would recommend 2 Digiboard EPC controllers and a 4-processor RISC computer for your RAS server.

Here are some very general guidelines for servers:
    Up to 40 clients, 486/66 with 48M of RAM
    Up to 64 clients, axp or MIPS with 64M of RAM, or P5 2-processor with 64M of RAM
    Up to 100 clients, MIPS or axp 2-processor with 64M RAM  (Yields about 70% CPU utilization.)
    More than 150 or so, use a 4-processor or better RISC computer.

For COM hardware, the Digiboard C/X controller is good.  For large client loads (70+)
on a single computer, I would recommend the Digiboard EPC controller, or two, to share
the load.

QUESTION:
RAS will not dial out. It shows on the screen that it is dialing out, but then returns an error stating that my modem and/or serial card is not functioning. This is strange since I can connect to CompuServe without errors. 

ANSWER:
COM software and RAS have different cabling needs. So, the fact that your COM software works does not assure that RAS will work.
Are you using a 25-pin to 9-pin Mouse cable adapter?  Or does your serial cable plug directly into the COM port on the computer and modem?

See the RAS on-line Help topic "Cabling Requirements" for details.

QUESTION:
How do I change the default timeout? I have searched the Registry and all other files 
and found nothing. Also, what do you define as idle, as I have had a 24-hour connection established, 
with absolutely no processing?

ANSWER:
You can change the idle timeout value in the Registry at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE on Local
Machine\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RemoteAccess\Parameters\Autodisconnect.
By default this value will be 0x14 (20 minutes). Change it to something like 0x5.

Idle is defined as no significant traffic over the link.  You can have a computer
connected with no visible processes running, but keep in mind things like the browser,
replication, etc. that run on the system without any user intervention.  These processes
can keep the RAS link alive.

---------------------------------------------------
QUESTION:
I've loaded RAS on a Windows NT Server computer that is a member server, not a domain controller. When I run RAS Administrator to grant dial-in privileges, I only see the local users -- Administrator and Guest, not the domain users. I can run User Manager for Domains and see the domain users, but RAS Administrator does not see them.  Must I load RAS on a domain controller to support people calling into my domain? 

ANSWER:
It sounds like you have RAS Administrator focused on the local computer instead of the domain.
In RAS Admin, from the Server menu, select the Select Domain or Server command and enter the domain name.
When the screen refreshes you should be able to view the domain RAS accounts.

QUESTION:
I connect often to a SLIP server using Netmanage Chamelion on my Windows for Workgroups computer every day. When I try to use my Windows NT Server version 3.5, I cannot connect and get a 611 error instead. I enter my login and password fine, but when I choose the Done button I instantly get the 611 error. It tells me the route is unknown. What can I do to get this up and running?

ANSWER:
Windows NT RAS cannot accept incoming SLIP calls. It will accept incoming PPP calls, and it will make outgoing PPP or SLIP calls. 
Configure your client software, Netmanage Chamelion on your Windows for Workgroups computer, to use PPP when it dials a Windows NT RAS server.

QUESTION:
I have a phone system that needs to let it ring at least twice before answering. Is there any way I can control how many rings occur before my RAS server answers a client call?
I have a US Robotics Sportster 14400 modem handling my calls.  Supposedly, an ATS0=2 command should do what I want but where can I enter this command?

ANSWER:
Edit your MODEM.INF file in the \systemroot\SYSTEM32\ras directory. Search for the
section [US Robotics Sportster 14400], and change the ATS0= entry to 2 or 3.

QUESTION:
I'm having problems being authenticated on the network after using RAS to connect from my home computer.
On my computer at home, the computer name is \\HOME and my user name is greg. 
When I start RAS from home and contact the office I can logon as Administrator, Greg, or
Guest and all three give me an Access Denied message when I try to access a share on the office computer. The office computer name is \\GREG.  The three above user accounts all exist on the \\GREG computer which is running RAS Administrator. Why am I getting this message?

ANSWER:
What is happening is that after logging into your local computer, your local credentials are being cached and used when you are trying to access your network. The RAS authentication does not override your cached credentials. Follow the steps below for explanation.

What's Happening:
1.  You logon locally to your computer at home. Your computer name is home, your user name is greg, and your password is password. (ex. \\HOME\greg password)
2.  Using RAS, you dial into your corporate network. An authentication dialog box appears and you supply your RAS logon credentials. Your domain name is corp, your user name on the domain is greg, and your password is password. (ex. \\CORP\greg password)
3.  The connection succeeds and you then try to connect to a computer in the domain, for example, your office computer \\GREG. This is where you get an Access Denied message.

Why:
The reason is that in step two above, your RAS logon does not log you onto the network. It only verifies that you are allowed physical access to the network. Therefore, here is the situation:
You are logged on locally as \\HOME\greg password. These credentials are cached and used for all resource access locally and on the network. When you dialed into the network using RAS, your cached creditials did not change. Therefore, when you try to connect to a resource on the network, you give it:
\\HOME\greg password and it is expecting \\CORP\greg password. 

Two Possible Solutions:
1.  In step three above, when you are tying to connect to a computer on the network, provide your network creditials to override your local creditials. For example, at a DOS prompt, you would type
NET USE * \\GREG\PUBLIC /U:CORP\GREG. Or, in File Manager, in the Network Connect Drive dialog box, you would type CORP\GREG in the Connect As box. 

2.  You can join the domain from home. This causes your domain creditials to be cached on your home computer. To do this, have an Administrator add the name of your computer at home, \\HOME, to the domain and change your workgroup or domain name to corp. Then, follow the steps described in the online Help topic "Joining a Domain."

QUESTION:
When I run NetDDE on my Windows NT Server version 3.5, I cannot chat with anyone
who logs into my server via RAS or see their computer even if they have connected to a drive
on my computer. 

ANSWER:
Have the person you are trying to talk to start CHAT on their computer, then connect to them, or refer to the section above "Using Winchat with RAS".

QUESTION:
When I connect to my local Internet host I use a script file to logon. But, when the script is finished I still have to manually press the Done button at the bottom of the window.
How can I automate this? It would be nice if some command in the script file could signal
"DONE", that way I could easily run a batch file via the AT service that would start a RAS 
connection and get my mail and news in the middle of the night, etc.

ANSWER:
There is no way to do this with terminal.  You can however, write a script that bypasses terminal and automates your logon. Once you have that working, you can use RASDIAL.EXE with the AT command. For more information about scripting, see the online Help topics about writing scripts.

QUESTION:
RAS gives the possibility to manage modem pooling connections, but I also need a dial-out service for Windows NT Server, like in NetWare Connect. Can you suggest a way?

ANSWER:
There is a Third-party modem pooling solution available for Windows NT, called Spartacom SAPS. You can reach Spartacom at Tel: (404) 455-0701 or Fax: (404) 457-9500.

---------------------------------------------------
QUESTION:
My RAS server presently uses DHCP to provide IP addresses to remote clients. If I understand 
the protocol correctly, this means that a large number of RAS sessions could exhaust the DHCP pool space, as the lease period is three days, and 'used' IP addresses do not get returned to the pool until after the three days are up.
For example if I had two RAS ports, eight DHCP addresses in the pool, and nine different
users accessed the server via RAS during one day, wouldn't the ninth find that there were no free IP address to allocate?
Is it therefore more prudent to use the static IP pool facility of RAS rather than DHCP, or is there something I have missed?

ANSWER:
For your two port server, you will only use three IP addresses: two for RAS clients and one for the server.  When a client calls in, it is given an IP address.  When the client hangs up, that address is returned to the RAS server for use with the next client.  So, no matter how many clients call in, at most you will use three addresses on your two port server at any given time.

QUESTION:
My LAN consists of one Novell 3.12 server and one Windows NT Server version 3.5. I would like to be able to remotely administer the Windows NT Server computer like I can using Rconsole in Novell.

I am going to be on the road much of the year and would like to be able to dial back into my Windows NT Server computer and troubleshoot remotely from my home computer or from my notebook computer like I can with Novell. I have talked with my local vendor and they have come back with the suggestion to install Windows NT Server version 3.5 on my home system and through RAS dial into my office server. Is this possible and is this the best way to do it?

ANSWER:
You do not need to install Windows NT Server on your home computer, you can do remote administration with Windows NT Workstation. If you install RAS on your office computer, you can then run RAS from the laptop to connect to it and do remote administration. 

For more information refer to the QUESTION and ANSWER section above which discusses an answer to your question in more detail.

QUESTION:
I'm getting the following Administrator Alert message from my Primary Domain Controller (PDC):
"Failed to authenticate with <UNKNOWN>, a Windows NT Domain Controller for
domain SITE2."

\\NTPDC is my primary domain controller at work and \\SITE2 is the domain controller at a second site.  They are set up to allow dial-in access from one to the other.  They both run Windows NT Server version 3.5.  What is this message trying to say and why does it occur hourly?

ANSWER:
The alert is telling you that one domain controller tried to connect with the other domain controller
to sync up the accounts, but the second domain controller could not be reached.
If you have a trust relationship between the two, and they are only connected via RAS, 
then you will get this alert when the connection is not active.

QUESTION:
Can I configure my Windows NT Server version 3.5 as a SLIP server for Windows for Workgroups clients? If so, what
do I need to do on the Windows NT Server side? What software will I need on the Windows for Workgroups client side?

ANSWER:
RAS is configurable as a PPP server, not as a SLIP server.  Unless there is a strong reason for using SLIP, just use the RAS that ships with Windows for Workgroups to connect to the Windows NT RAS server.
If you need IP instead of NetBEUI, use a third party PPP package on the Windows for Workgroups computer to give you PPP access.

---------------------------------------------------
QUESTION:
We have an Windows NT Server computer for our Windows for Workgroups clients. Is there a way for a Windows for Workgroups client to dial out
on the modem on the Windows NT Server using software like QuickLinks or Procom? Windows NT
is great for dialing in using RAS to connect to our network, but we need to share the modem at
the Windows NT Server to dial out from our workstations to access various BBSs or CompuServe.

ANSWER:
You will need to install a modem pooling package in order for this to work. You can use Spartacom software for this. Spartacom can be reached at Tel: (404) 455-0701 or Fax: (404) 457-9500.

QUESTION:
I have the call waiting service on my line at home - if someone calls me and my line is engaged then they are asked to wait and I get a gentle beep to tell me someone is waiting. This is a great idea for voice communication but my line goes down during data communication. I manually de-activate call waiting by phoning #43#. Can I automate this using RAS? I use RAS and Microsoft MSMail to connect to the office system from home.

ANSWER:
Add #43# to the beginning of the phone number Remote Access dials.

QUESTION:
After I modified the AutoDisconnect entry to five minutes, I restarted the computer, connected to our Internet Service Provider, and waited.  Ten minutes later the connection was still up. Maybe the ISP is pinging us? Or maybe the RAS AutoDisconnect feature just does not work?

ANSWER:
The RAS autodisconnect feature is tested regularly, and does work. Watch Remote Access Monitor to see if any packets are being sent. Just one packet will reset the idle disconnect timer to 0.
The autodisconnect is a Windows NT Server feature only. A RAS client does not autodisconnect.

QUESTION:
1) We have a Windows NT Server computer connected to a Novell network. We are using a
client/server package which communicates via IPX (NWIPXSPX.DLL), Gupta SQLBase
and a SQLWindows client application. We want clients to be able to use RAS to get to the Windows NT
Server computer, but also be able to hit the SQLBase NLM with an IPX protocol. Is this
possible?

2) Currently, RAS clients have a wide selection of COM ports to choose from.
Are there plans for RAS clients to use a NASI or network modem pool as their modem?
If so, how do we do this?

ANSWER:
1.) Have your RAS clients dial in using IPX.  They should then be able to access your IPX applications. Windows NT Workstation and Windows 95 RAS clients support IPX.

2.) There are plans for RAS to support modem pools in a future release. For now, you can use a package like SpartaCom for modem pooling on Windows NT.  You can reach Spartacom at Tel: (404) 455-0701 or Fax: (404) 457-9500.

QUESTION:
I am having a problem with my Hayes modem and RAS. Although I can connect to various 
locations with RAS without any problems, it normally takes a good ten or fifteen seconds to
hang up the modem (when selecting hang-up or exiting RAS completely).
I don't know if this is a RAS problem, modem problem or Windows NT problem. Has anyone
experienced this problem and, if so, can a remedy be given?

ANSWER:
In MODEM.INF, set the S3 value in the INIT string for your modem to something low like 1. 

---------------------------------------------------
QUESTION:
I have two Windows NT computers running RAS. One is running TCP/IP and is connected to the
Internet. The other Windows NT computer is on an isolated LAN. From this computer, I want to be able to connect to the first computer and access the Internet.
Does my second Windows NT computer need an IP address that will be recognized on
the Internet, or is the first Windows NT computer the one that actually communicates on the
Internet? When I am connected to the first Windows NT computer will I be a part of its subnet, or will I need my own subnet?

ANSWER:
See documentation in the Windows NT 3.5 Resource Kit on how to make this work.
