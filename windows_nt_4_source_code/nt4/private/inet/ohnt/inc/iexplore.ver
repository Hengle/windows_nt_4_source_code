/*
 *  IEXPLORE.VER
 *
 *      All this is needed so that we have a version number greater than
 *      that which shipped with Win95, but less than the version # used
 *      for the Nashville shell. Nashville, of course will have it's own
 *      special set of #defines.
 *	This will keep us from being removed by an update install of Win95's
 *	IEXPLORE, or by an install of Netscape Navigator, which has a tendency 
 *	to install an outdated version of URL.DLL.
