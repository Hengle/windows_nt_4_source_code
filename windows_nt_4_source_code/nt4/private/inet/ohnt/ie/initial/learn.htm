<H3>Learn About The Internet</H3>

<P>
Here's a dirty little secret about the Internet: There are only three things you need to know.

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<H4>1.  How do I get around the Internet?</H4>

<P>There are just two ways to navigate, and you already know one of them.

<UL>
<LI>To get somewhere, just click something. For example, you can click the up-arrow at the top of this page to get back to where you started. You will know something can be clicked if the mouse pointer changes to a hand when you point to it. <A HREF="file:TryClick.htm">Try clicking here!</A>

<LI>To find a specific page, type in its "address." Internet addresses look something like this:<P>

<CENTER><B>http://www.microsoft.com/hello.html</B></CENTER><P>

If someone gives you one, click the File menu, choose Open, type in the address, and press Enter. If Internet Explorer can find the page, it will open it for you.
</UL>

<H4>2.  How do I find specific things on the Internet?</H4>

<UL>
<LI>The Internet has "index sites" where interesting things are presented by category. To see one, go back to the main page by clicking the up-arrow at the top of this page, click "Explore The Internet," then click "The Yahoo Internet Index." You will see a famous site where you can find many things on the Internet merely by clicking.
<LI>You can also do an Internet Search. To do so, go back to the main page by clicking the up-arrow at the top of this page, then click "Search The Internet." From there, follow the instructions.
</UL>

If you find something you like, it's easy to remember it so you can get there later. Simply click the Favorites menu, choose Add To Favorites, and press Enter. From then on, the page will be available right in the Favorites menu. Try it with this page!

<BR>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<H4>3.  What if I get "lost"?</H4>

There are two easy ways to get back to something familiar:

<UL>
<LI>Clicking the "back-arrow" button on the Toolbar takes you to the page you were on before this one. Click it enough times and you're sure to find your way back to somewhere familiar.
<LI>If you're really lost, click the button that looks like a house. That will take you back to your "home base" on the Internet. (Later, when you find a page you like even better, you can make that your home base instead!)
</UL>
